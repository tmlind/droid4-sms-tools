Droid 4 SMS Tools

Minimal tools for Droid 4 to send and read SMS in PDU format from the
MDM6600 modem using /dev/motmdm3 and /dev/motmdm9 character devices with
Ruby mail and pdu_tools gems. These tools currently do not work with CDMA
networks because of different PDU format needed for sending and receiving
messages.

To install, install ruby and then gem install pdu_tools mail.

Script droid4-sms-send.rb can be used to send SMS with sendmail type
syntax:

$ echo "message" | droid4-sms-send.rb 1239567890

The droid4-sms-read.rb reads messages from the modem and copies them
in email format to ~/Maildir/INBOX.sms/new and then acks the received
SMS message.

If started with a PDU encoded SMS as a command line parameter, it just
decodes the PDU and shows it.

Note that the charset should be set to UTF-8 for special characters at
least for mutt. This can be done with set send_charset="us-ascii:utf-8"
in .muttrc.

Sending SMS can also be done with ModemManager mmcli. If you prefer to do
that, please see mmcli --help-messaging on how to first create a new SMS
on the modmem with mmcli --messaging-create-sms, and then how to send
it with mmcli --send option.

However, note that using USB keeps the SoC from entering deeper idle
states, so you probably want to unbind or unload all the USB devices
when not in use, or at least autosuspend them and the connected devices
via sysfs.
