Droid 4 SMS Tools

Minimal tools for Droid 4 to read SMS in PDU format from the MDM6600
modem using /dev/motmdm9 character device with Ruby pdu_tools.

To install, install ruby and then gem install pdu_tools.

The droid4-sms-read.rb reads messages from the modem and copies them
in email format to ~/Maildir/INBOX.sms/new and then acks the received
SMS message.

If started with a PDU encoded SMS as a command line parameter, it just
decodes the PDU and shows it.

Sending SMS currently needs to be done with ModemManager mmcli until the
PDU format needed for /dev/motmdm3 character device is unraveled. So for
now, please see mmcli --help-messaging on how to first create a new SMS
on the modmem with mmcli --messaging-create-sms, and then how to send
it with mmcli --send option.

Note that using USB keeps the SoC from entering deeper idle states,
so you probably want to unbind or unload all the USB devices when not
in use, or at least autosuspend them and the connected devices via sysfs.
